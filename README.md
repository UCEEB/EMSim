Energy Management Simulator

Peak shaving is the goal of the battery system and its management strategy in industrial complexes. The correct dimensioning of the battery storage and grid contracted power is crucial for both economic and ecological feasibility of such system. The purpose of the software is to enable a qualified design of the parameters of the battery storage and related infrastructure through mathematical calculations and to verify this design by a realistic simulation.
